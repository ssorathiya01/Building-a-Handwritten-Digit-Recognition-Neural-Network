# Building-a-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Neural-Network

Introduction:
In today’s digital age, handwriting digit recognition itself plays an important role in applications from mail filling to handwritten bank checks in this blog post we will dive into the exciting world of neural networks to explore how to build a simple but powerful model to recognize handwritten digits using Python and TensorFlow.

Understanding the Problem:
Imagine you have a data set of thousands of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each digit is represented as a grayscale image of 20x20 pixels Our goal is to train the neural network to classify that based on their image these digits exactly.

Building the Model:
Let’s start by building our neural network model using TensorFlow. We will use a Sequential model with Dense layers to create our mesh. Here is the code snippet:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
Define the model
model = Sequential([
 Dense(25, activation='relu', input_shape=(400,)),
 Dense(15, activation='relu'),
 Dense(10, activation='linear')
])
Compile the model
model.compile(
 loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
 optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
)
Train the model
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=40)
Data Preparation:


Before training our model, we need to load and preprocess our dataset. We will use a subset of the manual score dataset, with 5000 training samples. Here’s how we can input the data:

import os
from scipy.io import loadmat
Load data from file
data = loadmat(os.path.join('Data', 'ex3data1.mat'))
X, y = data['X'], data['y'].ravel()
Preprocess the data
y[y == 10] = 0  # Set the label for digit 0 to 0
Training the Model:
Once we have prepared our data, we can train our model using the fit method. During training, we monitor the loss to check the performance of the model. Here is how we can train the model:

history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=40)


Evaluation:
Once the model is trained, we can make predictions on a subset of the data set and evaluate its performance. To see how well our model performs, we will use their predicted characters to create some random images.

Conclusion:
In this blog post, we explored the method of building a neural network for handwriting digit recognition using TensorFlow. We saw how to build the model, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its application. With further research and fine-tuning, we can improve the accuracy of our model and apply it to real-world applications.
